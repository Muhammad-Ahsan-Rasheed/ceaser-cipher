# Motivation for this project

Cryptography is **the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and intended recipient of a message to view its contents**. The term is derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden.

`P.S: Letâ€™s imagine talking to friends in coding language.. `  :grin:

## Ceaser Cipher

The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. Itâ€™s simply a type of substitution cipher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
